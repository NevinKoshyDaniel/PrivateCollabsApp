# PrivateCollabsApp

PrivateCollabsApps(PCA) is an **Open Source Self Deployment Workspace Solution** built on top of popular Open Source Technologies,aiming to integrate various functionalities.
The pandemic has opened up the need for large scale collaboration apps, and large organizations, especially in the business and education sectors are trying to incorporate their entities under a single umbrella.<br>
The ever-growing privacy concerns are the reason for the use of open-source software stacks, and the capability to manage your formal communications in a private stack, highly customisable stack instance would be highly appreciated by the privacy-centric instances.

## Developer Views

The core idea of the project is to create an open-source communication and collaboration stack with individual and team-based communication and ensure the privacy of the users are protected. The solution is developed in such a way that anyone interested can host the services, which essentially gives individuals/organizations the freedom to use and decide their own native communication solutions.

The problem that I am trying to solve is the creation of an easily deployable & self-managed communication and collaboration stack, and I am making use of a few Open Source Softwares, and coupling them together with _various Azure Services_ to ensure a new smooth and easily deployable service.

The project aims to address the issues that most of the stacks are privately managed, and my aim is to make a completely open-source and self-manageable solution. In terms of analogy, I can call it the _student version_ of __Microsoft Teams__.


To sum up, the main capabilities of the solution would be:

    Support for all current browsers
    Mobile applications
    Team Based Chats & Collaboration
    Multiple Platform Integrations
    Inbuilt Conferencing Capabilites
    Content sharing
    End-to-End Encryption
    Raise hand and reactions
    HD audio and video
    Chat with private conversations
    Polls
    Virtual backgrounds
    Cloud Based Storage Solution (Need to integrate with demo)
    Active Directory based Authentications (Need to integrate with demo)
    Analytics and Insight (Need to be integrated)
